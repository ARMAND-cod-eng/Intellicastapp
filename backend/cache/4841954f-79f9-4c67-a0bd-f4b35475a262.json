{"id":"4841954f-79f9-4c67-a0bd-f4b35475a262","script":"The project plan outlines the development of an AI-powered educational content transformation platform designed to enhance and personalize learning experiences. The core features include advanced video processing, sophisticated podcast generation, smart document handling, and an intelligent learning assistant. Key enhancements in video processing involve a Smart Video Processing Suite that utilizes AI-driven scene detection, emotional tone analysis, and engagement metrics to transform long videos into engaging short formats (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels) with automatic hook generation for maximum retention. Additionally, the platform supports text-to-video conversion through an AI script writer, dynamic background video selection, and personalized voice synthesis. In podcast generation, the system offers single-voice narration with 20 customizable options, dynamic pacing, and multi-voice conversational modes that inject humor and analogies based on topics. For document processing, intelligent summarization, key concept extraction, and interactive quiz creation are included to enhance comprehension and engagement. The AI Learning Assistant (\"Brain\") provides personalized learning paths, adaptive difficulty adjustment, and context-aware responses to support learners effectively. The technical architecture is robust, incorporating microservices for backend operations, a comprehensive API gateway, and various cloud services like AWS EC2, S3, and CloudFront. Key algorithms include video highlight detection and text-to-video generation pipelines, ensuring efficient content transformation. The development roadmap spans 20 weeks, divided into foundational setup, core feature implementation, and advanced AI features integration phases, with detailed milestones for each phase to ensure smooth project progression.","voice":"emma","speed":1,"backgroundMusic":false,"musicType":"none","analysis":{"wordCount":1687,"sentenceCount":40,"paragraphCount":1,"characterCount":14373,"readingTime":7,"complexity":"complex","contentType":"technical","contentHash":"c17761493323521ced280b5fc685be1e","estimatedTokens":4791,"metadata":{"avgWordsPerSentence":42.18,"avgSentencesPerParagraph":40}},"audio":null,"createdAt":"2025-09-06T06:14:30.590Z"}
