The core feature set includes: 1. Smart Video Processing Suite: - Long-to-Short Video Converter: Utilizes AI-driven scene detection, importance scoring, and engagement metrics (visual complexity, motion, audio peaks) to identify \"golden moments,\" with the capability to generate multiple short formats suitable for TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels. - Automatic Hook Generation: Ensures maximum retention by creating engaging hooks based on analysis of content. 2. Advanced Podcast Generation: - Single Voice Narration & Multi-Voice Conversational Mode: Offers 20 voice options with dynamic pacing and natural conversation flow, including character personality customization for immersive storytelling. - Automatic Pause Insertion: Enhances comprehension by strategically inserting pauses in the narration. 3. Smart Document Processing: - Intelligent Summarization & Key Concept Extraction: Provides multi-level summaries and key concept visual mind maps to aid understanding and retention. - Interactive Presentation Builder: Optimizes AI layouts, selects appropriate images and animations, and generates speaker notes for enhanced presentation delivery. 4. AI Learning Assistant (\"Brain\"): - Personalized Learning Paths & Adaptive Difficulty Adjustment: Adapts content difficulty based on user performance and learning style detection. - Progress Tracking & Context-Aware Responses: Tracks user progress and provides context-specific assistance through interactive Q&A and step-by-step problem solving. The technical architecture leverages a microservices approach with FastAPI for backend operations, React, React Native, and Electron for frontend applications, and Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform for infrastructure management. Key algorithms include video highlight detection and text-to-video generation pipelines, while the development roadmap is structured into three phases: foundation setup, core feature implementation, and advanced AI integration.","voice":"default_en","speed":1,"backgroundMusic":false,"musicType":"none","analysis":{"wordCount":1687,"sentenceCount":40,"paragraphCount":1,"characterCount":14373,"readingTime":7,"complexity":"complex","contentType":"technical","contentHash":"c17761493323521ced280b5fc685be1e","estimatedTokens":4791,"metadata":{"avgWordsPerSentence":42.18,"avgSentencesPerParagraph":40}},"audio":null,"createdAt":"2025-09-08T00:13:07.961Z"}
