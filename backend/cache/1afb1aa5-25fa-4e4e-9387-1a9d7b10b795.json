Currently, the document processing pipeline is functioning correctly, but the PDF.js library needs to be configured for optimal browser compatibility to extract the full text content.\n\nFor immediate use, several alternative methods are available:\n1. Convert the PDF to a plain text format (.txt) and upload that.\n2. Save the PDF content as a Word document (.docx).\n3. Copy and paste the text directly into a new document.\n\nThis temporary message confirms that file upload is working properly, the document processing pipeline is active, and the file validation has passed. The system is prepared for podcast generation using these methods or once browser compatibility issues are resolved to extract the full PDF content.","voice":"emma","speed":1,"backgroundMusic":false,"musicType":"none","analysis":{"wordCount":156,"sentenceCount":8,"paragraphCount":7,"characterCount":998,"readingTime":1,"complexity":"medium","contentType":"general","contentHash":"42bfef2c9bd2997bf96ef1142a126352","estimatedTokens":333,"metadata":{"avgWordsPerSentence":19.5,"avgSentencesPerParagraph":1.14}},"createdAt":"2025-09-05T22:05:37.546Z"}
