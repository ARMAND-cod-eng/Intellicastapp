The core feature set includes: 1. Enhanced Feature Set: - Smart Video Processing Suite: This suite offers advanced capabilities such as long-to-short video conversion using AI-driven scene detection and importance scoring to identify \"golden moments\" based on engagement metrics, speech patterns, emotional tone, and educational value. It supports multiple short formats like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels, with automated subtitle generation and background music matching. - Advanced Podcast Generation: This feature enables the creation of single-voice narration and multi-voice conversational modes, customizing characters' personalities for natural conversation flow. It includes humor injection based on topics. - Smart Document Processing: Intelligent summarization, key concept extraction, automatic quiz generation, and interactive presentation building are supported to enhance document usability. - AI Learning Assistant (\"Brain\"): This feature provides personalized learning paths with adaptive difficulty adjustments, progress tracking, and context-aware responses. 2. Technical Architecture: - The platform is built using a microservices architecture with backend technologies like Python for video and audio services, and Node.js for analytics. Core frameworks include FastAPI for high-performance operations and PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis for data storage. - Key algorithms such as the Video Highlight Detection Algorithm and Text-to-Video Generation Pipeline are implemented to optimize content processing. - The technology stack includes React for web applications, React Native for mobile apps, Electron for desktop apps, and Docker with Kubernetes for containerization. Infrastructure services like AWS EC2, S3, CloudFront, and Lambda support the deployment. This platform is designed to revolutionize education by providing a comprehensive suite of tools that can transform any educational content into interactive, personalized learning experiences, making it accessible and engaging for diverse learners.","voice":"default_en","speed":1,"backgroundMusic":false,"musicType":"none","analysis":{"wordCount":1687,"sentenceCount":40,"paragraphCount":1,"characterCount":14373,"readingTime":7,"complexity":"complex","contentType":"technical","contentHash":"c17761493323521ced280b5fc685be1e","estimatedTokens":4791,"metadata":{"avgWordsPerSentence":42.18,"avgSentencesPerParagraph":40}},"audio":{"audioId":"chatterbox_en_6c8b5611","audioUrl":"/audio/chatterbox_en_6c8b5611.wav","duration":131.08,"fileSize":6291918,"model":"Chatterbox-Multilingual-Advanced"},"createdAt":"2025-09-08T01:14:09.266Z"}
